# QR-Code ScreenScanner

This programm scanns the screen for qr-codes and shows a clickable Label, with its contents below the qr-code thats next to the cursor.
The timings for scanning can be modified, right now its scanning every 300ms, this changes to 2000ms when no qr-code was seen in ~2000ms. Keep in mind that it will use a lot more computing power when taking screenshots more often.
